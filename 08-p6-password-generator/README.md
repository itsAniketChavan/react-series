# In this project we learned about another three hooks'
1 - useCallBack:

This hook is basically used to optimize the function.

2 - useEffect

This hook is used when we want to execute any functions at requred events, this time it helps us

3- useRef

This hook get the reference of the any particular tag or element.
In this project we will use the useRef hook to get the reference of the input tag
