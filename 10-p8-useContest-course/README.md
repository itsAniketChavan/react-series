# In this lecture we have learned about use Context API-

when we use props for data sending from one compoenent to another component.
In this process we have to send data accordingly to the flow like parent to child.

here we cannot access the data globally at any compoennt direclty.
To Overcome this - contextAPI comes.

The data which we want to access in differnt components, this data set by by useContext
So, here we can pass the data and access the data at any component.
